# Team 01 pathfinding simulations

## Prerequisites

To run the simulations in this folder, you must have the following prerequisites installed:

- G++ compiler (it is reccommended that you install it from [here](https://www.mingw-w64.org/))
- Python interpreter
- Windows Powershell

> **Note**: it is important that you have g++ and python in your path! For details on how to do this check out [this]()

## Basic start

Run `pathfinding.ps1` by:
- Right clicking `pathfinding.ps1` 

OR
- Opening terminal in this file directory and running: `./pathfinding.ps1`

### Using the program

The interface is a CLI program with instructions on how to carry out each action.

The currently supported ones are:

- Compile and run BFS/Dijkstras
- Visualise the generated map using python

> **Note:** you will need to create an empy folder in `/visualisation` called `outputs` in order for the algorithms to properly output.

The CLI interface will prompt you on what actions are required.
